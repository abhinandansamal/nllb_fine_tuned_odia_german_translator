It specifically uploads both the core, structured parallel corpus (`authentic_corpus_final.jsonl`) and the final training-ready version (`bidirectional_corpus_final.jsonl`), making both assets publicly available.\n","\n","## Methodology\n","The script uses the `huggingface_hub` library to programmatically manage the upload process. It performs the following steps:\n","\n","1. **Authentication:** Securely logs into a Hugging Face account using an access token.\n","2. **Repository Creation:** Creates a single, new dataset repository on the Hub.\n","3. **File Upload:** Sequentially uploads both specified `.jsonl` files from their local Google Drive paths to the same Hub repository.\n","\n","## Workflow\n","1. Mounts Google Drive to access the final corpus files.\n","\n","2. Installs the necessary `huggingface_hub` library.\n","\n","3. Prompts the user to log in to their Hugging Face account.\n","\n","4. Creates a new dataset repository on the Hub with a specified name.\n","\n","5. Uploads `authentic_corpus_final.jsonl`.\n","\n","6. Uploads `bidirectional_corpus_final.jsonl` to the same repository.\n","\n","## Input & Output\n","* **Input:** Two `.jsonl` files located in Google Drive.\n","* **Output:** A new, public dataset repository on the Hugging Face Hub containing both of the uploaded `.jsonl` files."],"metadata":{"id":"p7UYpb4ZQlMt"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"AFin0UfZQYTC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750841176818,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":16397,"user":{"displayName":"Abhinandan Samal","userId":"05606082246540318546"}},"outputId":"25facf6a-38dc-4680-94ac-2cb4fb73cbc1"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount(\"/content/drive\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Install the library to interact with the Hub\n","!pip install -q huggingface_hub"],"metadata":{"id":"1xVoYIxNQ_IE"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from huggingface_hub import login, HfApi\n","import os"],"metadata":{"id":"wJY0NbEjRMKh"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Authenticate with Hugging Face\n","from google.colab import userdata\n","huggingface_token = userdata.get('HF_TOKEN')\n","login(token=huggingface_token)"],"metadata":{"id":"dYiPYufJRRr3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# --- Configuration ---\n","# Hugging Face username\n","HF_USERNAME = \"abhinandansamal\" #
