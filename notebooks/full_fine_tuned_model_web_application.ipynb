It contains the complete, self-contained Python code required to build a Gradio-based user interface that allows users to perform bidirectional Odia-German translation.\n","\n","## Methodology\n","The script is designed to be a complete web application.\n","\n","1. **Model Loading:** It loads the final, fully fine-tuned model and its corresponding tokenizer directly from their repository on the Hugging Face Hub.\n","2. **Language Detection:** It implements a robust, hybrid language detection system. It first uses a script-based check to reliably identify Odia text. If the text is not Odia, it uses the `langdetect` library as a fallback to identify German or other languages.\n","3. **Translation Logic:** It defines a central `translate_text` function that takes user input, runs the detection logic, and calls the loaded `pipeline` with the correct source and target language codes to generate the translation.\n","4. **Web Interface:** It uses the `gradio` library to create a clean and intuitive user interface, complete with text boxes, a dropdown for manual language selection, and example sentences.\n","\n","## Workflow\n","1. Installs all required libraries (`gradio`, `transformers`, `langdetect`, etc.).\n","2. Loads the fully fine-tuned model and tokenizer from the Hub.\n","3. Defines the language detection and translation functions.\n","4. Creates the Gradio `Interface` object.\n","5. Launches the web application, creating a temporary public URL for testing in the Colab environment.\n","\n","## Input & Output\n","* **Input:** Text entered by a user into the Gradio web interface.\n","* **Output:** A live, interactive Gradio web application for bidirectional Odia-German translation."],"metadata":{"id":"tFywIdRFXSEW"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Uninstall all
