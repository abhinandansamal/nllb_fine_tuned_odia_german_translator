This provides a direct, quantitative measure of the storage efficiency of each fine-tuning method, a key finding for the thesis's comparative analysis.\n","\n","## Methodology\n","The script uses Python's built-in `os` library to perform a recursive walk through the specified model directories. It calculates the total size by summing the size of every individual file within each folder. The final byte count is then converted into a human-readable format (e.g., GB, MB, KB).\n","\n","## Workflow\n","1. Mounts Google Drive to access the saved model folders.\n","2. Configures the file paths for the final FFT and LoRA model directories.\n","3. Defines helper functions to calculate the total size of a directory and to format the byte count.\n","4. Executes the calculation for each of the two model paths.\n","5. Prints a clean summary report to the console, showing the final artifact size for each model.\n","\n","## Input & Output\n","* **Input:** Two folders in Google Drive containing the saved artifacts of the fine-tuned models.\n","* **Output:** A printed message to the console reporting the human-readable on-disk size of each model folder. No new files are created."],"metadata":{"id":"Dib0yAWJRE0L"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount(\"/content/drive\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"1ytZ7AKeQIIV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1751612768899,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":30442,"user":{"displayName":"Abhinandan Samal","userId":"05606082246540318546"}},"outputId":"c9781f99-71b8-4684-857e-180e8b9b9cae"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import os"],"metadata":{"id":"LQrRZVQnQoSy"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"-CCpWgB3PnhT"},"outputs":[],"source":["# --- CONFIGURATION ---\n","FINAL_FFT_MODEL_PATH = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/Thesis/model/nllb-odia-german-translator_model_final\"\n","FINAL_LORA_MODEL_PATH = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/Thesis/model/lora-odia-german-translator\""]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# --- HELPER FUNCTIONS ---\n","def get_folder_size(folder_path):\n","  \"\"\"\n","  Calculates the total size of a folder and its contents in bytes.\n","\n","  This function recursively traverses a specified folder and its subdirectories using `os.walk`,\n","  summing the sizes of all files encountered.
