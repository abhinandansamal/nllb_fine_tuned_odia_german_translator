It serves as a foundational component of the data collection pipeline, designed to extract, clean, and filter raw article text to produce a monolingual Odia text file suitable for downstream NLP tasks, including the creation of a parallel corpus.\n","\n","## Methodology\n","This script employs a robust, hybrid approach to ensure accurate extraction of both article metadata and its main content.\n","\n","* **Data Fetching:** Uses the `requests` library to download the raw HTML of the target URL.\n","\n","* **Metadata Extraction:** Leverages the `newspaper3k` library for its reliable ability to parse the document and extract the article's title.\n","\n","* **Content Extraction:** Employs the `BeautifulSoup` library for a more granular and precise extraction of the main article body, specifically targeting the primary content `<div>` of the newspaper's layout.\n","\n","* **Language Filtering:** A custom function (`filter_odia_text`) programmatically isolates characters belonging to the Odia script (Unicode range `U+0B00`–`U+0B7F`), along with essential punctuation. This is a critical step to remove all non-Odia text (e.g., English words, navigation links) and create a pure monolingual corpus.\n","\n","## Workflow\n","The notebook executes the following sequential steps:\n","\n","1. Mounts Google Drive to ensure persistent storage of the output.\n","\n","2. Installs all necessary Python dependencies.\n","\n","3. Fetches the HTML content from a specified article URL.\n","\n","4. Parses the HTML to extract the title and main body text.\n","\n","5. Cleans the extracted text by removing known boilerplate phrases and normalizing whitespace.\n","\n","6. Filters the cleaned text, retaining only Odia-language characters and punctuation.\n","\n","7. Saves the final, clean Odia text to a `.txt` file in the specified Google Drive directory.\n","\n","## Input & Output\n","* **Input:** A single string variable, `article_url`, containing the URL to a news article.\n","\n","* **Output:** A single `.txt` file (e.g., `dharitri_odia_article_filtered_100.txt`) saved to Google Drive, containing the article's title and its filtered, clean Odia text."],"metadata":{"id":"KxTHCfrgm0sU"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount(\"/content/drive\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"hrnZONOhUK6Q","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749102579325,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":16589,"user":{"displayName":"Abhinandan Samal","userId":"14217244922582465016"}},"outputId":"3e3a8be4-290c-4a8d-c6c3-00d24c4325e0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install -q newspaper3k"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"3bRRjyGyUWDB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749102185794,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":13888,"user":{"displayName":"Abhinandan Samal","userId":"14217244922582465016"}},"outputId":"7c4023fb-61b5-447e-ca6a-486430e8b8eb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m7.4/7.4 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m70.4 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m211.1/211.1 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m13.7 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m81.3/81.3 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m5.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m107.4/107.4 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m8.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h  Building wheel for tinysegmenter (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Building wheel for feedfinder2 (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Building wheel for jieba3k (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Building wheel for sgmllib3k (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install lxml_html_clean"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"LQ4Kk-gmU6bZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749102194745,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":7377,"user":{"displayName":"Abhinandan Samal","userId":"14217244922582465016"}},"outputId":"0b8c9119-248f-4b47-aa6b-70e38b104a87"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Collecting lxml_html_clean\n","  Downloading lxml_html_clean-0.4.2-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (2.4 kB)\n","Requirement already satisfied: lxml in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from lxml_html_clean) (5.4.0)\n","Downloading lxml_html_clean-0.4.2-py3-none-any.whl (14 kB)\n","Installing collected packages: lxml_html_clean\n","Successfully installed lxml_html_clean-0.4.2\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"m50GNkOmUCc6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749106192398,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":3561,"user":{"displayName":"Abhinandan Samal","userId":"14217244922582465016"}},"outputId":"79f70dd0-7c94-4430-a8b6-118d37e2eed3"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Attempting to fetch article from: https://www.dharitri.com/kismis-will-make-you-beautiful/\n","Warning: Could not find the main article content div ('td-post-content').
