It verifies that two separate, monolingual text files (one in Odia, one in German) have the exact same number of lines. This is an essential quality assurance step before merging them into a parallel corpus, as any mismatch in line counts would lead to data corruption and catastrophic failure during model training.\n","\n","## Methodology\n","The script programmatically counts the total number of lines, including blank lines, in each of the two specified source files. It then compares these two counts and provides a clear success or error message to the user, immediately flagging any alignment issues.\n","\n","## Workflow\n","1. Mounts Google Drive to access the source files.\n","\n","2. Configures the file paths for the Odia and German `.txt` files.\n","\n","3. Reads both files line-by-line to get an accurate count.\n","\n","4. Compares the final line counts.\n","\n","5. Prints a status report indicating whether the files are perfectly aligned or if a mismatch exists.\n","\n","## Input & Output\n","* **Input:** Two `.txt` files (`authentic_odia_corpus.txt` and `authentic_german_corpus.txt`).\n","* **Output:** A printed message to the console confirming the line counts and the alignment status.
